### Description
This repository is from an assignment completed in EDS 213 (Data & Database Management), which is a course offered in the [Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. The analysis combines multiple datasets with various meteorological and ice duration records in the Madison, WI area (specifically Lake Mendota, Lake Monona, and Lake Wingra) to examine the impact of shifting climatic conditions on ice duration in the region.
